Sketch of detector pipeline:

1. Tiger click detector
2. a set of features for each click, feel …
3. use a classifier to select clicks that are potentially beach whales.
4. Select bouts ~ runs ~1m to 30m sequences. Gap between bouts is ~ 20min
5. Simple sensitive click detector, uses peak2peak but applied only within bouts to find all of the clicks in the bout.
6. first pass: hand label each bout as “false”,”jervais” or “courtesies”
7. 2nd pass: consider only non-false bouts: go though the bouts and take out the clicks that don’t fit the assigned label.
8. Error estimation pass: quantify the rate of false clicks (5-7 %)
       Windows = 5 minute time. (<1% error).

First task: classification:
after step 5, we have have the following instances

Each instance is a bout.

The information for a bout is:
Start and end time of the bout.

for each click in the bout we have:
1. Time
2. time since previous click.
3. peak2peak amplitude
4. wave-form (202 data point, 16 bit)
5. spectra (101 data points)

on average, about 1000 clicks per bout.

Classification is into “False”, “Gervais”, “Cuviers”

Second Task: cleaning:

Given the classification, got back to each bout and remove the clicks that do not belong to the class.

Data structure:

For each bout, store complete history, i.e.:

1. initial bout as it came out of step 5
2. initial manual label
3. a sequence of updates of the form
    1. times of foreign clicks that are removed
    2. Potential relabeling.
