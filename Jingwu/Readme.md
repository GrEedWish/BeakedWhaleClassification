Terms:

- Click detector: devices with algorithm filters that identify impulse signals to detect echolocation clicks.

- Click spectra: click pressure level as a function of frequency, is computed from the click waveform using FFT.

- Inter-click-interval: the time difference between two clicks.

- Click bout: the clicks can be separated into "bouts" of clicks, where each bout usually corresponds to a single species.

- Peak-to-peak amplitude: the difference between the max and the min of the wave form.

- Click time series: an interval of click waveform, which is transformed to click spectra using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Certain samples before and after each detected click were included in the click time series.
